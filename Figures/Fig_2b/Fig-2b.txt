11 qubits 1-D TFIM VQE simulations ran with 10,000 shots and no depolarization noise.
With list of parameters obtained from VQE, we do the following.
1) From simulations, Energy and HR distance are measured with 4000 shots and now with the depolarization noise. The p1 and p2 values are set as the IONQ Harmony's approx. 1 and 2 qubit gate fidelities (p1 = 0.0065 and p2 = 0.0398)

2) From simulations, Fidelities are measured only with depolarization noise, using density matrix simulation.(p1 = 0.0065 and p2 = 0.0398).
