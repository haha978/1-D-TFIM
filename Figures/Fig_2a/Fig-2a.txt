11 qubits 1-D TFIM VQE simulations ran with 10,000 shots and no depolarization noise.
With list of parameters obtained from VQE, we first SAMPLE some parameters (due to limited budget) and do the following.
1) For each sampled parameters, Energy and HR distance are measured with 4000 shots using 11 qubit IONQ Harmony
2) For each sampled parameters, Fidelities are measured only with the depolarization noise, using density matrix simulation.(p1 = 0.0065 and p2 = 0.0398).
