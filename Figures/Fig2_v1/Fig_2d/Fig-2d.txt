- 3x2 J1-J2 VQE is done with no depolarization noise, with 10,000 shots.
- We use the parameters from VQE to do the following
 1) HR distance and Energy is measured with depolarization noise and with 10,000 shots, using the list of parameters from VQE. IONQ Harmony's 1 and 2 qubit gate fidelities (0.0065 and 0.0398) are used as the p1 and p2 values for the depolarization noise.
 3) Fidelity is measured with depolarization noise only.
