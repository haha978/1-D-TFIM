- 3x2 J1-J2 VQE is done with no depolarization noise, with 10,000 shots.
- We use the parameters from VQE to do the following
 1) we chose some list of parameters from the VQE. We decided not to use all the parameters, as we need to run the experiment in an actual hardware. 
 2) HR distance and Energy is measured with depolarization noise and with 10,000 shots, using the chosen list of parameters. IONQ Harmony's 1 and 2 qubit gate fidelities (0.0065 and 0.0398) are used as the p1 and p2 values for the depolarization noise.
 3) Fidelity is measured with depolarization noise.
 4) BOTH HR distance and Energy will be measured in the actual IONQ hardware in the future.
